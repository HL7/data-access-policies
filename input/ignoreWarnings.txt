# These are known issues 
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.dap: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[0]: The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 6.0.0-ballot3 but package hl7.terminology.r5#6.3.0 is based on FHIR version 5.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.dap: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[1]: The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 6.0.0-ballot3 but package hl7.fhir.uv.security-label-ds4p#current is based on FHIR version 4.0.1. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.dap: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[1]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.security-label-ds4p#current released on 2023-04-17, but the most recent appropriate version is 1.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
