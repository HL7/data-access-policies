ERROR: There is no jira specification file defined with the expected name of FHIR-dap in the xml folder of the  https://github.com/HL7/Jira-Spec-Artifacts project.  This must exist before ballot or publication.

# These are known issues because we are building with R6
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.dap: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[1]: The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 6.0.0-ballot3 but package hl7.fhir.uv.security-label-ds4p#1.0.0 is based on FHIR version 4.0.1. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
