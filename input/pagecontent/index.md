<div markdown="1" class="stu-note">

The top menu allows quick navigation to the different sections, and a [Table of Contents](toc.html)Â is provided with the entire content of this Implementation Guide. (Be aware that some pages have multiple tabs).

### Use-Case analysis

This IG purpose is to include use-case analysis to enable the FHIR [Permission]({{site.data.fhir.path}}permission.html) resource to mature. These use-cases will confirm where the Permission resource is properly constructed, where updates are needed, and where core extensions and vocabulary are needed.

The use-cases and analysis are found on these pages:

- [Simple explicit permission of a given resource to a given organization](non-patient.html)
- [Consent with rules in Permissions](consent.html)
- [Bundle with residual enforcement rules in Permission](residual.html)
- [Overriding Policy in a Permission format](overriding.html)
- [Provider Directory](providerDirectoryFineGrain.html)
- [Patient Directory](patientDirectory.html)

### Permission

[Permission]({{site.data.fhir.path}}permission.html) is a portion of an Access Control environment. It is provided in FHIR form to enable Access Control rules to more naturally utilize the FHIR model.
