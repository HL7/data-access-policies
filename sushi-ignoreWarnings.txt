SUSHI support for pre-release versions of FHIR is experimental. Use at your own risk!


# These are the invariant tests, not supported 
The following files were not added to the ImplementationGuide JSON because they are not in one of the supported input folders or are nested too deep in one of those folders. While SUSHI automatically supports resources in sub-folders, the IG Publisher does not, unless the folder is explicitly added via the template or an IG parameter. To fix any issues you may encounter due to this, adjust your IG parameters or template accordingly or move these files so they are directly under a supported input folder (e.g., input/resources, input/profiles, etc.)
